# Node references editor

Simple node based editor tool that displays components of game objects as nodes, and allows setting up references between them.

Features:
Filtering by component type, field reference type.
Displaying parent/child transform hierarchy of game objects using stacked colored windows.

Was done as a learning project across ~2 days - there's lots of bad practices and it's very rushed, but it should get the job done. Use at your own risk.

## Using the tool

Right click on a game object in the scene hierarchy, or a transform component in the inspector, and select "Node references editor".
You can set up the default filters etc. in "Project Settings" under "Node references editor".
